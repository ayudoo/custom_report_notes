Overview
--------

Odoo report templates are very flexible and can be overridden and styled as you like.
However, managing these templates separately can be cumbersome or become quite an
overhead.

This module adds configurable `Custom Report Notes` to your `Sales Orders`,
`Delivery Slips` and `Invoices`. These documents are similar in kind and you can
enhance them with your reusable notes.


Usage
-----

In ``General Settings`` -> ``Document Layout`` open `Custom Report Notes`. Note, that
you need permissions of group `System` to be able to create new notes.

You can choose the type of report and where exactly to insert the note by selecting one
of the fields ``Address``, ``Heading``, ``Table``, ``Signature/Comment`` and ``Bottom``,
as well as whether to place it ``before`` or ``after``.

They provide the full power of the Odoo wysiwyg editor, use it with caution.
